====================

logging information about what actors send what message to what other actor can help in figuring out problems. This project consists in two phases. In phase I, you have to add logging capabilities to Scala so that information is captured about the execution. In phase II you have to use these logs to produce useful information for the user to figure out what could have gone wrong.
